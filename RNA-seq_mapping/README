# RNA-seq read mapping README

A collection of paired-end Illumina based RNA-seq reads was mapped to the draft assembly to evaluate how
well Platynereis dumerilii RNA is represented by the genome. 

The genome assemblies used for mapping include only the PacBio data; the Nanopore data on account of the
very low BUSCO scores were not used for further analyses.

## Software used includes:
STAR
Bowtie2
