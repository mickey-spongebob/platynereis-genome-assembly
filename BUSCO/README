# BUSCO analysis README file

## Describes the BUSCO quality checks for the current genome assemblies.
## Versions. BUSCO v3.0.1, OrthoDB v9

## Background
BUSCO: Benchmarking Universal Single Copy Orthologs, is an algorithm developed and maintained by the Zdobnov
lab, that provides a quantitative measure of how many single copy orthologs are contained in the assembly. 
Depending on the dataset, it can provide a proxy as to how complete the current assembly is. 

## Data
We compared two distinct genome assembly methods as well as two different long-read sequencing strategies.

### Sequencing data
  1. Oxford Nanopore sequencing: performed in EMBL, Heidelberg-GERMANY
  2. PacBio sequencing: performed in University of Florida, Whitney Laboratory
  
### Assembly methods
  1. CANU
  2. FALCON

The data files below were used as input to the BUSCO algorithm.

#### platy.falcon.fa
#### canu_nanopore.contigs.fasta
